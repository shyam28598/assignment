Times must be eight digits in HH:MM:SS format (HH:MM:SS is also accepted, if the hour begins with 0). \nNote: Trips that span multiple dates will have stop times greater than 24:00:00. For example, if a trip begins at 10:30:00 p.m. and ends at 2:15:00 a.m. on the following day, the stop times would be 22:30:00 and 26:15:00. Entering those stop times as 22:30:00 and 02:15:00 would not produce the desired results.
